    <h3 id="2"><span class="c12">What is a Web App?</span></h3>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c8">Learn about web apps and what goes into building them.</span></p>
    <h4 id="2a"><span class="c2">What is a Web Application?</span></h4>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c8">A web application is an application software that does not require installation and
            can instead be accessed from a remote server via web browser. Web applications are made for interaction,
            allowing users to send and consume data between the browser and the web server. This interaction can be as
            simple as logging in to an account, or as complex as making a payment with your credit card.</span></p>
    <h4 id="2b"><span class="c2">What is the Difference Between a Website and a Web
            Application?</span></h4>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c8">While the terms website and web application are often used interchangeably, they can
            denote somewhat different things. Most commonly, a website is defined as a set of information-carrying pages
            that are inter-related and accessed through a web browser. A web application, on the other hand, is an
            application software that runs on a web server and is accessed by the user through a web browser.</span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c8">If a website could be said to be defined by its content, then a web application would
            be defined by its interaction with the user. As such, web applications are significantly more complicated
            than static websites, both in general architecture and features.</span></p>
    <h4 id="2c"><span class="c2">Web Application Architecture</span></h4>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c8">In order to facilitate this complex flow of data, web applications are usually
            designed with different layers. The most common design paradigm is a three-layered design consisting of a
            presentation layer (web browser), application layer (server), and storage layer (database). In this system,
            the presentation layer is responsible for relaying user data to the application layer, which can process
            that data and do any number of things, including passing it to the storage layer for
            &ldquo;safe-keeping.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c8">Many times, web applications can grow to be very complex. In these cases, a
            three-layered design may fall short. This may necessitate the introduction of additional layers to handle
            this complexity. For instance, the introduction of an integration layer between the application and storage
            layers can help provide a uniform interface for data access, allowing the application layer to be insulated
            from changes that occur to the storage layer implementation.</span></p>

    <p class="c5"><span class="c8">Learn what a Single-Page Application (SPA) is and why you would use it.</span></p>
    <h4 id="3a"><span class="c2">Introduction</span></h4>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c8">At this point in your web development journey, you have learned HTML to create web
            pages, CSS to style those pages, and JavaScript to sprinkle some magic throughout for functionality. With
            these foundational skills, you are now ready to explore the exciting web development practice of the
            Single-Page Application (SPA). SPAs combine the content of traditional websites with the smooth user
            experience of mobile applications. Learning to develop and maintain SPAs is an exciting venture that
            challenges developers to improve the web experience for users all over the world.</span></p>
    <h4 id="3b"><span class="c2">Multi-Page Applications</span></h4>
    <p class="c5"><span>Prior to reading this article, you should be familiar with the concept of a</span><span><a
                class="c3"
                href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1663324173497572&amp;usg=AOvVaw3WriPWmuH2ndflPI1sdOP3">&nbsp;</a></span><span
            class="c1"><a class="c3"
                href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1663324173497837&amp;usg=AOvVaw0WnGxIIgVp4mZq6xVQ3Mpw">web
                app</a></span><span class="c8">. Whether talking about delivering content through static websites or
            interactivity through web applications, the article is referring to a multi-page file structure that lives
            on a server. Each time new data is needed for the browser view, a request is sent to the server, which
            returns a new set of page files. For a static website, this approach is generally fine, but web applications
            that require faster and more complicated interaction sometimes struggle to keep up.</span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c8">Imagine if there was a restaurant where you can only eat one part of your meal at a
            time. For an order including a burger, fries, and salad, the server(server!) brings out just the burger.
            After a few bites you want some fries, so the server takes the burger back to the kitchen and brings back
            just the fries. The server may have even had to wait for the fries to process&ndash;I mean prepare, before
            returning to the table. Repeat the request, prepare, and serve steps with the salad, then the burger again
            and then more fries and you&rsquo;ve now eaten at the weirdest, most inefficient restaurant ever. Thankfully
            this doesn&rsquo;t happen in the food industry but something similar is happening on the web.</span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span>In the following video, a user is navigating around</span><span><a class="c3"
                href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1663324173498452&amp;usg=AOvVaw1dXuGJVp8FY-ejUR8lII60">&nbsp;</a></span><span

            class="c8">. On the right, you may recognize the Elements tab of Chrome DevTools displaying an HTML file
            associated with the page in the browser.</span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c8">Every time a link is clicked a new page is displayed in DevTools, which means a
            request to the server was made and a new set of files was sent to be rendered in the browser. This is just
            like our burger, fries, and salad from our favorite restaurant. In terms of a web application where
            interactivity is key, these file requests can mean a slow user experience. That&rsquo;s where the
            Single-Page Application comes in.</span></p>
    <h4 id="3c"><span class="c2">Single-Page Applications</span></h4>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c1"><a class="c3"
                href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1663324173499343&amp;usg=AOvVaw0RoIBXfd5M3rR4bAeRFoUW">Wikipedia
                defines</a></span><span class="c8">&nbsp;a single-page application (SPA) as &ldquo;a web application
            that interacts with the web browser by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from a web
            server, instead of the default method of the browser loading entire new pages.&rdquo; The name single-page
            application generally refers to the application consisting of one page that is constantly updated by
            JavaScript. Requests to the server are now quicker since they contain just the data needed to update the
            view. SPAs are full applications, running in the browser yet still connected to a server to update any
            application data.</span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c8">If our favorite restaurant converts to the single-page approach, when we order our
            meal the server brings the fully prepared burger, fries, and a salad at once. We now have access to devour
            what we want without the server going to and from the kitchen. At times we may want ketchup for the fries,
            or some dressing for the salad, but those are delivered quickly and come from the kitchen already prepared.
            Just like a single-page application, you are given almost everything you need upfront but can still request
            smaller items to help with each item of the meal.</span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span>Now we have a video of user interactions on the</span><span><a class="c3"
                href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://reactjs.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1663324173499941&amp;usg=AOvVaw1zTI1kn5XOikdDkIjYi7-F">&nbsp;</a></span><span

            Elements panel this time, each interaction changes only parts of the HTML file.</span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c8">The file stays constant while logic from the client-side JavaScript changes only what
            is needed to update the view. Requests for data are retrieved a lot quicker than files that need to be
            processed on a server and then rendered in the browser. SPAs focus on speed when it comes to user
            interaction and browser rendering times.</span></p>
    <h4 id="3d"><span class="c2">SPA Frameworks</span></h4>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c8">To create a SPA you can use vanilla JavaScript for controlling all the required
            logic. In practice, the complexity of SPAs scales rapidly so just using JavaScript is not recommended.
            Luckily, there are several tools available to help with the creation of a SPA. These tools help with many
            tasks from controlling the view of the page to managing the application build.</span></p>

        <li class="c5 c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8">SPAs are fast. The main selling point of a SPA is that it feels
                like a desktop or mobile application. By eliminating requests for new files and only relying on smaller
                amounts of data from the server, SPAs provide a real-time interface with their users.</span></li>
        <li class="c5 c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8">Reuse of code is a big bonus when using SPAs because it saves
                time within a project and across multiple projects. Many SPA libraries and frameworks advise that
                components be general enough that they can be reused from project to project.</span></li>
        <li class="c5 c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8">SPAs provide an easier path to migrate code to a mobile
                application. With a SPA, the back-end of the application feeds data to the decoupled front-end
                interface. This separation of tasks allows the creation of a mobile app UI while maintaining the
                back-end logic of the application.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c13"><span class="c9">Cons</span></p>
    <ul class="c11 lst-kix_8i82jml046ph-0 start">
        <li class="c5 c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8">SPAs require more files to run at startup so the load time of
                the application can be longer. This is something to consider if a user will not want to visit a site
                that takes too long to load. SPA load time can be minimized through strategically loading resources
                throughout the run of an application.</span></li>
        <li class="c5 c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8">Search Engine Optimization (SEO) has some pitfalls when it comes
                to SPAs. Search engines, like Google or DuckDuckGo, index pages of a website to rank the content. This
                can be difficult with only one page that may not have content until it is loaded by JavaScript. SEO is
                an ever-changing world so strategies already exist to mitigate these downsides.</span></li>
        <li class="c5 c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8">SPAs may not function as expected within the browser. For
                example, the back button or browsing history can act differently while using a single-page application.
                This can be frustrating for users who are expecting certain functionality within their browsers.</span>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="3f"><span class="c2">Conclusion</span></h4>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c8">Single-page applications provide a better user experience while running within a web
            browser. They are the right choice for applications that need to provide real-time or complex interaction
            with their users. Creating a SPA involves more than just a handful of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, but
            their complexity continues to be minimized by frameworks such as React and Vue.js. Even if your next
            application is not a SPA, knowing how to implement them is a must-have skill for a front-end
            developer.</span></p>
