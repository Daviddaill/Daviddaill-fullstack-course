                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">In this article, you&rsquo;ll learn about digital accessibility and why
                                it is
                                important to incorporate aspects of digital accessibility into websites.</span></p>
                <h3 id="1a"><span class="c11">What is Accessibility?</span></h3>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Accessibility refers to designing devices, products, and environments
                                such that
                                individuals with disabilities or sensory impairments can successfully use the device or
                                product.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">In 1990, the United States Congress passed the Americans with
                                Disabilities Act,
                                commonly referred to as the ADA. The ADA mandates that public and private spaces be made
                                accessible to
                                individuals with disabilities that include (but are not limited to):</span></p>
                <ul class="c10 lst-kix_gzinsm6ao3bo-0 start">
                        <li class="c2 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Sensory impairments</span></li>
                        <li class="c2 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Cognitive impairments</span></li>
                        <li class="c2 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Physical limitations</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">For example, the ADA requires on-ramps as an alternative way of accessing
                                a staircase
                                for individuals who may use a wheelchair. Another example is that stop lights use hues
                                of green, yellow, or
                                red that are readily discernable to individuals with visual impairments (like
                                colorblindness).</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Although the ADA has forced public and private spaces to incorporate
                                accessibility
                                best practices, one frontier that has been mostly untouched has been digital
                                accessibility, or,
                                accessibility in digital media, like websites and mobile apps. In this article,
                                we&rsquo;ll explore digital
                                accessibility and why it is essential on the Internet.</span></p>
                <h3 id="1b"><span class="c11">What is Digital Accessibility?</span></h3>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Although the concept of digital accessibility refers specifically to
                                digital media,
                                it&rsquo;s not much different from the general idea of accessibility.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">The requirements for accessibility in digital media are, of course, very
                                different,
                                however.</span></p>

                <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Evolving Technology</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">The ADA was passed during a time where the Internet was still growing and
                                evolving
                                (1990). Since that time, the popularity of the Internet (and general accessibility to
                                it) has exploded. As
                                new technologies are invented, the methods they use to incorporate elements of
                                accessibility will have to be
                                revisited, perhaps even by challenging the current ADA.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Legal Ramifications</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">The Internet&rsquo;s explosion in popularity has emphasized the
                                accessibility of
                                websites and other digital media. As such, it also has pushed the ADA to new limits.
                                Should the statutes in
                                the ADA cover digital media as well? The U.S. Department of Justice certainly thinks
                                so:</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c17">&ldquo;[T]he Department has long considered websites to be covered by
                                Title III
                                despite the fact that there are no specific technical requirements for websites
                                currently in the regulation
                                or ADA Standards&rdquo;.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">In the past, accessibility lawsuits focused on lack of on-ramps, lack of
                                braille in
                                signs, and the like. Today, accessibility lawsuits also focus on the lack of
                                accessibility in digital media,
                                which emphasizes the user demand behind incorporating accessibility best

                <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Universal Design Benefits All</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Earlier, you read about one example that showcases an ADA mandate:
                                on-ramps should
                                accompany staircases to accommodate individuals with physical impairments. The reality
                                is that this mandate
                                doesn&rsquo;t just benefit those with physical impairments; it also benefits individuals
                                with baby
                                strollers, bicycles, and more.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">The same is true for digital accessibility. For example, having alt tags
                                that explain
                                the content of images are useful to all users whenever images don&rsquo;t load due to
                                connectivity problems.
                                Writing more semantic HTML tags and image captions also can improve your website&rsquo;s
                                standing in search
                                engines, as they provide the search engine more information about the content that your
                                site delivers. In
                                short, incorporating accessibility (digital or otherwise) contributes to a universal
                                design that ultimately
                                benefits all, which can improve the user experience for everyone.</span></p>

                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">The general concept of accessibility, which previously applied mostly to
                                physical,
                                public and private spaces, now applies to the digital world, thanks to the widespread
                                popularity of a new
                                technology: the Internet.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">New technologies, litigation, business strategies, and more continue to
                                push the
                                definition of accessibility. Today, this definition has expanded to included digital
                                media, like websites
                                and mobile apps. The Internet continues to provide digital solutions to a wider
                                audience, making it
                                imperative for web developers to incorporate elements of digital accessibility.</span>

                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Contrast refers to the opposition of different properties (color, size,
                                shape, font,
                                etc) to make one object visually distinct from another.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Careful use of contrast will aid all users in skimming or navigating our
                                pages, by
                                directing our user&rsquo;s attention, and by visually communicating what is most
                                important and what is not
                                as important.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Making sure that enough contrast exists between different elements can
                                help us ensure
                                that our site is accessible to users with vision impairments.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">In this lesson, we will cover creating accessibility-enhancing contrast
                                through:</span></p>

                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Text is used differently on the web than it is in a book. Users are often
                                trying to
                                navigate websites as quickly as possible.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Breaking large chunks of text into different sections that have their own
                                headings
                                and subheadings is essential to helping them find the content that they are looking
                                for.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">In HTML, there are six heading elements, &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;. The
                                heading
                                elements decrease in importance and size as the heading number increases. This means
                                that an &lt;h1&gt;
                                carries a higher rank than an &lt;h6&gt;.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Heading elements in HTML accomplish several things:</span></p>

                        <li class="c2 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">they create visual contrast, with lower-numbered
                                        headers like h1

                        <li class="c2 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">they provide navigation and contextual

                </ul>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">As an added benefit, having a keyword in an h1 tag will typically impact

                                results more than having the same keyword in a p tag, because it is assumed that words

                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Highly accessible websites use real text instead of images of text, use

                                high contrast with its background, and choose highly legible font sizes.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Let&rsquo;s dive into each of these concepts a bit more.</span></p>

                                between the text
                                and the text&rsquo;s background color. According to the Web Content Accessibility
                                Guidelines, a ratio of at
                                least 4.5:1 should be used on all standard text sizes. This means the lighter color must

                                The standard
                                font size for most modern web browsers is 16 pixels. This allows users to scan your
                                website and consume
                                information without straining their eyes. While smaller type sizes can be used, they
                                should be reserved for
                                nonessential content or design aesthetic only.</span></p>
                <h3 id="2d"><span class="c11">Color Accessibility</span></h3>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">When using color in our designs, it&rsquo;s important to note the
                                contrast between
                                elements in the foreground and those in the background.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Sufficient color contrast can improve the usability of your site for
                                users with low
                                vision or color blindness.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">For instance, using the combination of black (#00000) as a foreground
                                color and white
                                (#ffffff) as a background color provides maximum contrast.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">While this is a fairly common color combination for text on a page, the
                                high contrast
                                can also cause glare that will increase strain on the user&rsquo;s eyes over
                                time.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">On the other hand, using colors that are too similar, or lacking adequate
                                contrast,
                                can hinder users from being able to comprehend the content on the screen.</span></p>

                                general, about 8% of men and 0.5% of women have a color vision deficiency.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Designing color combinations for color-blind users can enhance the

                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">There are many forms of color blindness. The most common is red-green

                                blindness, where those two colors are often indistinguishable. For instance, if a

                                is looking at the color purple, it may appear blue as they do not perceive the red
                                pigment.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">People can also have blue-yellow color vision deficiency, and total color

                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">New web design trends come and go, and many times they are aesthetically
                                appealing,
                                but they are not always the most usable or accessible.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">You now know enough principles of accessibility and usability to be able
                                to judge if
                                these trends will create problems for your users. Let&rsquo;s reason through a few
                                examples.</span></p>
                <p class="c13"><span class="c1">Text Overlaid on Images</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">White text overlaid on an image is a popular design trend. However, it
                                doesn&rsquo;t
                                adhere to standards as the contrast is often too low. Adding a dark transparent overlay
                                on top of the image
                                could increase the contrast and provide better legibility.</span></p>
                <p class="c13"><span class="c1">Removing Input Labels</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Another trend often seen in web design is the removal of labels above
                                input fields,
                                sometimes relying on placeholder text instead to identify the input field.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">While this enhances the aesthetic quality of a design in some instances,
                                it can
                                hinder a user&rsquo;s ability to identify which input they are attempting to fill out.
                                This is particularly
                                true for low vision users because the placeholder text is often light gray and low
                                contrast. This also
                                creates problems for users employing screen readers, because the form&rsquo;s
                                placeholder text is not always
                                narrated.</span></p>

                                recent years. This trend
                                has improved usability in some ways, as it has encouraged designers to remove visual
                                effects that are not
                                contributing to the usability of their site.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">However, minimalism can go too far, especially if it obscures how users
                                should
                                navigate the site. Visual contrast is especially important for buttons and links because
                                these are the tools
                                our users employ to navigate. Color alone should not be used to indicate clickability,
                                as this will cause
                                challenges for low vision and color-blind users.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Taking into consideration color choices, contrast, and font legibility
                                will help you

                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">When designing a website, it is important to keep in mind that some users
                                access the
                                Internet in many different ways. For example, many users with a visual impairment use
                                screen readers to
                                access content on the Internet.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">A screen reader is a piece of software that provides an audio description
                                of a web
                                page&rsquo;s content. A screen reader not only reads the visual content out loud, it
                                also reads out element
                                names and other attributes that make it easier for visually impaired users to navigate a
                                web page.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="c2"><span>In the early days of the Internet, many pages were saturated with graphics and flash
                                animations.
                                Screen readers, unfortunately, could not interpret these types of elements. As such, a

                                example, the &lt;header&gt; element is intended to contain introductory and navigational
                                elements such as a
                                logo, links, or a search bar.</span></p>

                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Some HTML elements, like &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt;, only serve to

                                information on a web page. When a screen reader navigates a page, however, it reads out
                                to the user each
                                element&rsquo;s name as it encounters them. Therefore, reading &ldquo;ol&ldquo; outloud
                                will slow down
                                visually impaired users.</span></p>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c5">We can instruct screen readers to skip reading unnecessary elements by

                                acceptable, as a user does not need to hear the element&rsquo;s name (&ldquo;ordered
                                list&rdquo;) to
                                understand the content of a list.</span></p>

                                tag will cause the
                                screen reader to skip directly to the text between the &lt;li&gt; tags (it will not read
                                the names of the

                                is a better choice for elements that do not support the alt attribute.</span></p>
